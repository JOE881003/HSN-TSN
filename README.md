## Description
I wanted to scrape vehicle data from the European automotive website [https://www.kfzteile24.de/] and compare it with the data in the company's SQL database to verify accuracy. So, I developed a Python program that connects to the SQL database, automatically extracts relevant keywords, and transmits them to the website for automated searching. The program records all necessary search results, and I also built a GUI to make it easier for staff to use.
