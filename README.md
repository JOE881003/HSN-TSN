## Description
I wanted to scrape vehicle data from the European automotive website ([kfzteile24](https://www..de/) and [die versicherer](https://www.dieversicherer.de/versicherer/auto/typklassenabfrage)) and compare it with the data in the company's SQL database to verify accuracy. So, I developed a Python program that connects to the SQL database, automatically extracts relevant keywords, and transmits them to the website for automated searching. The program records all necessary search results, and I also built a GUI to make it easier for staff to use.
